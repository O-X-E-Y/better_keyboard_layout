## CURRENTLY UNFINISHED AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING

### Tool to assess and generate keyboard layouts

The goal of this thing is to be able to generate optimised
layouts for latin languages, might add support for other
alphabets in the future

Even though the project in its entirety isn't finished,
whatever is in here now should be stable!
